# OpenKin remote access

OpenKin (`kin` daemon) is a **single HTTP port** (default `7777`) with token auth on every request. Any tunnel, reverse proxy, or VPN that can forward plain HTTP to that port works — Kin does not special-case vendors beyond the optional Tailscale/tsnet plug-in.

| Rung | Command | Who can reach it |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Local | `kin serve` | This machine only (`127.0.0.1`) |
| LAN | `kin serve --lan` | Devices on the same Wi‑Fi/LAN; terminal QR |
| Tailnet | `kin serve --tailscale` | Your Tailscale/Headscale tailnet |
| Funnel | `kin serve --tailscale --funnel` | Public HTTPS via Tailscale Funnel |
| BYO tunnel | `kin serve --lan` (or local) behind frp / Cloudflare Tunnel / nginx / … | Whatever the tunnel exposes |

Token auth applies on **every** rung (`Authorization: Bearer` or `?token=` for browser links). On a public endpoint the token is the only barrier — treat it as a secret. If it leaks:

```bash
kin token rotate
```

A running daemon **re-reads `~/.kin/token` on every request**, so the old token stops working immediately without a restart.

## 1. LAN QR

```bash
kin serve --lan
# optional: --port 7777
```

- Binds `0.0.0.0:<port>` (still reachable as `127.0.0.1` for local MCP).
- Prints an `open:` browser URL with the master token and a `pair:` QR URL
  containing a five-minute one-time pairing secret.
- Open the browser URL for Web/Electron administration. Scan the `pair:` QR
  from iOS to exchange it for a revocable device credential.

Approve a task from the Approvals page as in the M2 flow.

## 2. Tailscale (tsnet)

Requirements: a Tailscale account (free tier is fine). Kin embeds a tsnet node named **`kin`**; state lives in `~/.kin/tsnet/`.

```bash
kin serve --tailscale
# or with LAN as well:
kin serve --lan --tailscale
```

### First run (login)

On first start, tsnet prints a login URL to the terminal (via its user logger), for example:

```text
To start this tsnet server, … go to: https://login.tailscale.com/a/…
```

Open that URL in a browser, authenticate, and approve the device. Subsequent starts reuse `~/.kin/tsnet/` and skip login.

Once up, Kin prints a master-token `open:` URL and a one-time `pair:` QR.
Open the browser link from any device on your tailnet or scan the pairing QR
from iOS.

### Funnel (public HTTPS)

Funnel is **Tailscale-only** (not Headscale).

1. In the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns), enable HTTPS and Funnel for your tailnet (DNS → HTTPS Certificates; Funnel policy as prompted).
2. Run:

```bash
kin serve --tailscale --funnel
```

3. Kin serves public HTTPS via Funnel and prints browser and native pairing
   links for the public URL. Phone on cellular (no Tailscale client required
   for Funnel) can open the browser link or scan the pairing QR.

`--funnel` requires `--tailscale`. Combining `--funnel` with `--ts-control-url` exits with an error before starting anything.

---

## 3. Headscale

Pass your Headscale coordination URL:

```bash
kin serve --tailscale --ts-control-url https://headscale.example.com
```

This sets `tsnet.Server.ControlURL` (also stored as setting `tailscale.control_url`). Node name remains `kin`; state dir remains `~/.kin/tsnet/`.

Enroll the node per your Headscale docs (pre-auth key via `TS_AUTHKEY`, or the printed auth URL if your server issues one).

**Funnel is not available** against a custom control URL — Kin refuses `--funnel --ts-control-url …`.

---

## 4. frp (recommended where Tailscale is unreachable)

In regions where the Tailscale control plane or DERP paths are unreliable (e.g. mainland China), **frp** is the recommended bring-your-own path: Kin stays a dumb HTTP origin; frp carries the traffic.

### Server (`frps`) — public VPS

`frps.toml`:

```toml
bindPort = 7000
# Optional dashboard
webServer.addr = "0.0.0.0"
webServer.port = 7500
webServer.user = "admin"
webServer.password = "change-me"

# Auth — use a strong token
auth.method = "token"
auth.token = "replace-with-long-random-secret"
```

```bash
frps -c frps.toml
```

Open TCP `7000` (and your remote port below) on the VPS firewall.

### Client (`frpc`) — machine running Kin

Start Kin on LAN or loopback:

```bash
kin serve --lan --port 7777
```

`frpc.toml`:

```toml
serverAddr = "your.vps.example.com"
serverPort = 7000
auth.method = "token"
auth.token = "replace-with-long-random-secret"

[[proxies]]
name = "kin"
type = "tcp"
localIP = "127.0.0.1"
localPort = 7777
remotePort = 17777
```

```bash
frpc -c frpc.toml
```

Reach Kin at `http://your.vps.example.com:17777/?token=<token>`.

Set the deep-link base so notifications point at the public URL:

- Settings UI → **UI base URL** → `http://your.vps.example.com:17777`
- or `PUT /api/settings` with `{"ui.base_url":"http://your.vps.example.com:17777"}`

For HTTPS, put Caddy/nginx + Let’s Encrypt in front of `remotePort`, or use frp’s HTTPS proxy type — Kin itself stays HTTP.

---

## 5. Cloudflare Tunnel

On the Kin host:

```bash
kin serve --lan --port 7777   # or plain serve on loopback
```

Install [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/), then either:

**Quick tunnel (ephemeral URL):**

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:7777
```

Copy the printed `https://….trycloudflare.com` URL, append `?token=<token>`, open on your phone.

**Named tunnel (stable hostname) — recommended for daily phone / multi-device use:**

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create kin
cloudflared tunnel route dns kin kin.example.com
```

`config.yml`:

```yaml
tunnel: <TUNNEL_ID>
credentials-file: /path/to/<TUNNEL_ID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: kin.example.com
    service: http://127.0.0.1:7777
  - service: http_status:404
```

```bash
cloudflared tunnel run kin
```

Prefer origin on **loopback** (`kin serve` without `--lan`) so only the tunnel exposes Kin.

Set `ui.base_url` to `https://kin.example.com` for notification deep links. Open the phone once with
`https://kin.example.com/?token=<token>` (token lands in `localStorage`).

Full multi-device setup, process supervision (launchd/systemd), WebSocket notes, security hardening
(optional Cloudflare Access), and acceptance checks:

## Security notes

- Kin is one HTTP port; **any** tunnel works unmodified.
- The **token** is the only application-level barrier on a public endpoint. Prefer short-lived exposure, Tailscale ACLs, or reverse-proxy IP allowlists when you can.
- Rotate with `kin token rotate` if the token may have leaked.
- `/internal/*` (approval MCP bridge) remains loopback-only in addition to token auth.
- Native QR pairing exchanges a one-time five-minute secret for a revocable
  device credential. Do not treat the QR value as the daemon master token.
- `kin serve --relay` uses a random room and a separate relay key persisted
  under `~/.kin/relay/`. The Relay is bring-your-own Cloudflare infrastructure:
  Cloudflare terminates TLS and can observe proxied traffic; this is not E2EE.
- Deploy the Relay with `relay/wrangler.toml`; it requires the `RELAY_ROOM`
  Durable Object binding. Do not use the old process-local Worker snippet.
