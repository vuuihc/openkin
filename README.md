# OpenKin

[中文](./README.zh.md)

> **OpenKin** — local-first multi-agent console & personal coach.  
> CLI: `kin` (alias: `ok`)

```text
One console for all your coding agents. Self-hosted. Any device.
Your agent. Your memory. Any model.
```

Dispatch, watch, and approve agent tasks — Claude Code, Codex, any CLI — from your phone or any device, over your own network. No vendor relay, no OpenKin account. Growing into a local-first personal agent (**Kin**) whose memory you own.

**Naming**

| Layer | Name | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|
| Project / brand | **OpenKin** | Searchable open-source name |
| Product subject | **Kin** | The continuous local agent you own |
| CLI | `kin` | Optional alias: `ok` |
| Data dir (today) | `~/.kin` | Unchanged for compatibility |

> **Not the same product as** [Kin / mykin.ai](https://mykin.ai) (commercial personal-AI companion app for iOS/Android). OpenKin is an independent open-source project.

## Quick start

```bash
# One command — no Go, no Node.js needed
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vuuihc/openkin/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Start controlling from your iPhone
kin serve --lan          # same WiFi
# or
kin serve --tailscale    # anywhere with Tailscale
# or (deploy relay first — see relay/README.md)
kin serve --relay wss://kin-relay.your-domain.workers.dev
```

**iOS companion app** — see [ios/README.md](https://github.com/vuuihc/openkin/blob/main/ios/README.md) for the TestFlight track or build from source.

## Status

MVP agent console (daemon + web UI) is implemented. A macOS menu-bar **desktop shell** lives in `desktop/` (Electron). Public docs describe **direction**; implementation notes are in [docs/IMPL_NOTES.md](./docs/IMPL_NOTES.md).

## In short

- **Cross-agent console** — dispatch / monitor / approve Claude Code, Codex, or any CLI agent from one place
- **Self-hosted remote** — LAN → tailnet / Funnel ladder; traffic never routed through an agent vendor's cloud
- **Cost transparency** — tokens and spend per task, per provider
- **User-owned** — local-first; no OpenKin account; export and leave
- **Artifacts, next** — keep readable session deliverables (study notes, HTML) in a local library with a reader; see [docs/TODO.md](./docs/TODO.md)
- **Memory, later (v2)** — governed memory that travels across agents and models
- **Small by default** — do not multiply entities without necessity; grow from real pain ([PRINCIPLE §5.11](./PRINCIPLE.md))

## Desktop app

macOS menu-bar shell (darwin-arm64). Supervises the local `kin` daemon as a sidecar, hosts the embedded web console in a BrowserWindow, and surfaces approvals as native notifications.

```bash
# Dev: builds ./kin, launches Electron (uses repo-root binary)
make desktop-dev

# Packaged unsigned .dmg under desktop/dist-electron/
make desktop-dist
```

**Unsigned builds:** after installing the `.dmg`, macOS Gatekeeper may block open. Right-click the app → **Open** the first time (or remove quarantine: `xattr -cr /Applications/Kin.app`). Code signing is not configured yet.

Architecture and decisions: [docs/IMPL_NOTES.md](./docs/IMPL_NOTES.md) § Desktop shell.
